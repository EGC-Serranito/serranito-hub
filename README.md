# Serranito-hub

Repository of feature models in UVL format integrated with Zenodo and flamapy following Open Science principles - Developed by DiversoLab.

### New Implementation

We are excited to announce several new features that we have integrated into the project to enhance its functionality and user experience. Our team has worked diligently to bring you the following improvements:
- A comprehensive UVL editor for seamless model creation and editing.
- Bot integration to automate routine tasks and improve efficiency.
- A user-friendly dashboard that provides an overview of key metrics and activities.
- A suite of new test cases to ensure robustness and reliability.
- A tag cloud feature for better organization and navigation.
- The ability to view user profiles, enhancing community interaction.
- Fakenodo, a tool for simulating node behaviors.
- Functionality to upload, analyze, and repair UVL files.
- An improved user interface for a more intuitive experience.
- The option to download all datasets in one go.
- Enhanced sign-up validation to ensure secure access.

  ## Project Objectives

  Let's thoroughly develop each Work Item of the project.

  ### WI View User Profile

  - User Details: This view allows us to see the details of the user to whom the dataset belongs, as well as other datasets assigned to them and the ability to filter by tags. If the user is the same as the logged-in user, it would display the profile view.

  </div>

### WI Tag Cloud

  - In the explore view, a cloud has been implemented to display the tags associated with the datasets. When clicking on a tag within the cloud, it filters the FMs that belong to the datasets associated with that tag.
